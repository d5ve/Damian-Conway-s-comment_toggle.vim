Damian Conway's comment_toggle.vim

Copied from https://github.com/thoughtstream/Damian-Conway-s-Vim-Setup/tree/master/plugin

Two changes so far:

* Packaged in a way that allows easy installing in modern vims.

    git clone https://github.com/d5ve/Damian-Conway-s-comment_toggle.vim.git \
        ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/Damian-Conway-s-comment_toggle.vim

* An attempt was made to add golang with gofmt support to the plugin. The
  plugin could already deal with commenting and uncommenting lines in golang
  files, following the example given for C. However, if you use gofmt, then the
  commented lines may be indented so that the `//` chars are no longer at the
  very beginining of the line. This meant you couldn't toggle comments. So the
  plugin now also toggles when there are whitespace characters only between the
  start of the line and any comment chars.
  i.e. from matching `^//` to also matching `^\s*//` for all languages.
  NOTE: THIS LIKELY BREAKS SOME OTHER BEHAVIOUR.

Totally unsupported.
